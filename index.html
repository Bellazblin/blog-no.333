<h2>explain</h2>
The opening of this site is due to the need to explain. For one, as a social being, there is a need to explain why I choose to do anything, or probably not... but at least out of love, I FEEL the need to explain. I want to be understood.
For two, there must be ways to explain all thing that exist.. or must it? After all, how real are all the thing that exist?
