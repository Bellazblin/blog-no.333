For a long time, I just did not want to agree that the nature of language lies only in all what can be perceived. 

The problem is that when you say "I am tired" and then I say "I am tired", the tireness may be two completely different things.
In order for me to understand how tired you are, or even how tired I am, we need to understand a lot of things.

Now I remember the exact thought about the relationship between day and night: I don't take a new day to be a new start any more. In reality, you will wake up to the same thing. 
It is a continuumn. It is a constant development thing. You don't wake up to restart again. You also don't wake up to a new me. Rest is important, but not for you to come to a blank new canvas when you wake up the next day. 
Your life from the beginning to the end is a continuum.
It is a new perspective for me and not an easy one to discover. I mean this is actually about thinking "long-term" which I have tried to stick with it for sometime. 
But along the way, because I have been emphasizing on the long-term effect, I was telling myself to take time and do it my pace. However, this sometimes slip into an excuse. Because often time, I go to sleep with the attitude to set everything aside and ignore them and expect that things will be fine the next day. 
I was using the sleep in quite a strange way. 
But I really did very good. This twist of perspective actually arrived after the experiment and constant learning and also after I have developed some professional skills and so now I don't feel so anxious about the future anymore. 
Carefully choosing who to hang out with is also such an important factor for the quality of my life. 
Day and night day and night day and night ... it is not so circular, not closing and opening again and again. When one second adds on to the last one, the timeline is only accumulating. 
This is the perception of time that I have been trying to break, but now I need to come back to stick with it, however, in a different contextual understanding about this continuum is like after 32 years of day in day out struggles.


<h1> 16-08-2024 </h1>
After relaxing so much today, I went to the city. It is the first time I have the feeling that it is not necessary that I need to wake up 
to make a difference of my life of some sort. The switch between sleeping and awakening actually should not be so divided. For such a long time now, 
I have always been feeling like sleep is a way to "exit" reality and even a way for me to escape. In sleep, I don't have to do anything...and it is so good. I do have a big passion on sleep, if I have to be honest.

When we say "my life" we often refer to the awakening life. At least that's to me. I don't know where this is coming from. However, our sleeping life can be quite long. 
And what is the problem if our sleeping life has to be longer than our awakening life? 
I think I know where this is coming from. 
This is from the "fact" that we believe that the time of our life is limited by caculating the days of existence/having a body. 
This is true in some sense, but it can be untrue in some other sense. In a lot of culture, we have saying like "making every minute counts" and "using time efficiently" or even "make sure you don't waste your life" and so on.. 
All these run in me and guide my everyday behavior. Most detrimental and present should be the economic model... it has been so integrated in every aspect that it is so difficult for me to jump out. Even if I do, I don't have another one to 
replace that and hence I don't know how to behave anymore...

I can clearly see that the opposite can be true - the sleeping is the main part and the awakening is just the supplementary part.
You need to do things in your awakening time and following the physics of it but there is certainly not the only "limited" time and space to exist. 

The feeling is actually quite subtle. If I were to put it as a summary that can be more relatable is this: you don't actually plan your day, rountine, and deadline and even set goals the way I used to think about them.
Like the way I planned or blocked time on my Google calendar, at least not in the sense that I should do it strictly for a long time in order to build a habit. I was quite obssessed about the fact that if I don't develop 
a rountine and a habit by disciplining myself until I do them automatically then I am not developing myself. Allowing yourself to be deeply relaxed or even in the trans-state is highly important.
I should not think about "making every minitue" counts in my awakening hours. 


<h3>AI&Linguistics reflections<h3/>
Problems in AI translation: 
What am I supposed to do with X? 
This construction comes with some "attitude". It is expressing some kind of annoyance. It is not just asking "What should I do with X".
The translation of this sentence to German was found to be "Was soll ich mit diesem Papier machen" which cannot match it in the pragmatic meaning.

Until today, writing never interested me. I was always confused about what words actually describe and convey. 
Now, I understand a bit better — but only better enough to know that it is foundamentally confusing.
However, I realize that, despite its inability to describe the truth accurately, 
the confusion inherent in language is systematic and has served our functioning in this three-dimensional world to some extent. 
In other words, language is powerful in sustaining the illusion of reality.
With this understanding, it is fascinating to consider what kind of possible worlds writing can construct, 
both within and beyond our current realm. This is why writing has suddenly become an appealing endeavor to me.

Sometimes you just feel so empowered that, you cannot speak or just make a noise.
You feel like if you do, you would break the silence and peace that are inside the empowerment.

<h2>explain</h2>
The opening of this site is due to the need to explain. For one, as a social being, there is a need to explain why I choose to do anything, or probably not... but at least out of love, I FEEL the need to explain. I want to be understood.
For two, there must be ways to explain all thing that exist.. or must it? After all, how real are all the thing that exist?
